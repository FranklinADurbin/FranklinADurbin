- Hello, I'm Franklin Durbin.
- I have a strong interest in Software Engineering. I developed this interest from my father who was a very good outside the box thinker.

-I'm currently learning Java, Python, PowerShell, VBS, Linux and Oracle and MySQL.
-Some of these learnings I am using in my current role, other in school, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science
with a concentration of Software Engineering.
